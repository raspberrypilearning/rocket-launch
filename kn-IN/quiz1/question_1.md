Which output would you expect if you ran the program below?

```python

  print(i)
```

--- choices ---

- ( )  1 <br> 2 <br> 3 <br> 4 <br> 5

Not quite, a `for` loop in Python starts from 0, unless otherwise specified.

- ( ) i <br> i <br> i <br> i <br> i

  --- feedback ---

Not quite, the **loop variable** from a `for` loop — in this case `i` — holds the current value from the sequence the loop is working through.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) 0 <br> 1 <br> 2 <br> 3 <br> 4

  --- feedback ---

Correct. The loop runs once, in order, for each item `i` in the range [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) 4 <br>  3 <br> 2 <br> 1 <br> 0

  --- feedback ---

Not quite. Unless you have specified otherwise, a `for` loop will start at 0 and count up the number of times specified in the range.
