## Reaching orbit

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

The point of launching the rocket is to propel a satellite into orbit. 

An orbit is a curved path that one object takes around another due to gravity.

The rocket will change colour to show how successful the launch was.

Create two new global variables to set the radius of the orbit circle and the y coordinate of the orbit t the point the rocket centre needs to reach to launch the satellite.

# Setup global variables 
screen_size = 400
rocket_y = screen_size # start at the bottom
burn = 100 
orbit_radius = 250
orbit_y = screen_size - orbit_radius

Update the `draw_background()` function to draw an ellipse to represent the satellite orbit that the rocket needs to reach.  

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_background()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 16
line_highlights: 20-24

def draw_background():
  background(0) # short for background(0, 0, 0) - black 
  image(planet, width/2, height, 300, 300)

  # Draw the orbit
  no_fill() # Turn off any fill
  stroke(255) # Set a white stroke
  stroke_weight(2)
  ellipse(width/2, height, orbit_radius*2, orbit_radius*2)
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your program and check that a white orbit line is drawn.

--- /task ---

The rocket should stop when it reaches the satellite orbit - the end of the mission. 

--- task ---

Update your `if fuel >= burn` code to also check that the rocket hasn't reached the orbit. 

You can use an `and` in `if` statements to check if two, or more, conditions are true.

# The draw_rocket function goes here
def draw_rocket():
  
  global rocket_y, fuel, burn # say we want to use the global variables
  
    if fuel >= burn and rocket_y > orbit_y: # still flying
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your project and enter 50000 as the amount of fuel. This should be plenty of fuel to reach orbit. The rocket should stop moving when it reaches orbit. 

--- /task ---

The rocket should be coloured red if it runs out of fuel before getting high enough to launch the satellite.

    fill(200, 200, 200, 100) # transparent grey

      ellipse(width/2 + randint(-5, 5), rocket_y + randint(20, 50), randint(5, 10), randint(5, 10))

  if fuel < burn and rocket_y > orbit_y: # No more fuel and not in orbit
    tint(255, 0, 0) # Failure

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code and enter 20000 as the amount of fuel. Check that the rocket turns red when it stops below the orbit.

Oh no, the planet has turned red! 

--- /task ---

--- task ---
The `tint()` function sets the tint colour for all images that are drawn until you change the tint or use `no_tint()` to turn it off.

**Choose:** Add a call to `no_tint()` after drawing the image so that the planet isn't tinted red in the next frame - or leave it if you like the planet turning red! 

--- code ---

language: python
filename: main.py - draw_rocket()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 45
line_highlights: 49

if fuel < burn and rocket_y > orbit_y: 
  tint(255, 0, 0) # Failure
    
image(rocket, width/2, rocket_y, 64, 64)
no_tint() # so we don't tint the planet in the next frame!
  
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Use the `tint()` function again, this time to colour the rocket green if the rocket has enough fuel to reach the satellite orbit:  

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_rocket()
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 45
line_highlights: 47-48
---
if fuel < burn and rocket_y > orbit_y: 
  tint(255, 0, 0) # Failure
elif rocket_y <= orbit_y:
  tint(0, 255, 0) # Success

image(rocket, width/2, rocket_y, 64, 64)
no_tint() # so we don't tint the planet in the next frame!
  
--- /code ---
--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your project and enter 50000 as the amount of fuel. Check that your rocket turns green when it reaches the satellite orbit.

--- /task ---

You now have a simulation that can be used to show how much fuel is needed as a minimum to reach the satellite orbit. That's great but you can take a huge amount of fuel and still success - which is costly and wasteful! 

--- task ---

Amend the condition in your success code to only turn green if the rocket reaches the orbit `and` with less than 1000kg of fuel left. 

Add code to colour the rocket yellow if the rocket has more than 1000kg of fuel left when it reaches orbit.

language: python
filename: main.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 45
line_highlights: 47, 49-50

if fuel < burn and rocket_y > orbit_y: 
  tint(255, 0, 0) # Failure
elif fuel < 1000 and rocket_y <= orbit_y:
  tint(0, 255, 0) # Success
elif fuel >= 1000 and rocket_y <= orbit_y: 
  tint(255, 200, 0) # Too much fuel
    
image(rocket, width/2, rocket_y, 64, 64)
no_tint() # so we don't tint the planet in the next frame!
--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your program several times with different numbers, 25000kg of fuel should be the amount needed to turn green but check that yellow works too by using a bigger number.
