## Upgrade your project
Your project is complete, but you can still make it better if you want. Here are a few upgrades to consider:

 + Let the user set the rate at which the rocket burns fuel or how far the rocket flies in each frame.
 + Add a second, higher, orbit for the rocket to reach and drop off another satellite. Have it change colour again when it gets there. 
 + Add you own rocket or planet image to use in your project.

If you want to use your own picture for the planet — or the rocket — then you can do that by choosing the **View and Add Images** button.

Then choose **Image Library** and follow the on-screen instructions to upload an image to your Trinket image library.

Note the filename of the image you've uploaded, and use it in the code in place of `planet.png`.
