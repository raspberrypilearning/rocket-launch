## Upgrade your project
Your project is complete, but you can still make it better if you want. Here are a few upgrades to consider:

 + Let the user set the rate at which the rocket burns fuel or how far the rocket flies in each frame.
 + Add a second, higher, orbit for the rocket to reach and drop off another satellite. Have it change colour again when it gets there. 

Here's a version of the project with all those upgrades, so you can see how they could work. Click Run to launch the rocket:
