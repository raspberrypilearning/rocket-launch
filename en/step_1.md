## Introduction

Make an animation of a rocket launching into orbit. The amount of fuel you give it will decide whether or not it successfully reaches orbit.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Computer programming and space flight:**</span> Computers, and computer programmers, have been a part of spaceflight since it began. The maths needed to get spacecraft into space and move them around there are just too complex for humans to do as fast as astronauts need the answers. 
<br>
These days, computers go to space with the astronauts but, in the early days of spaceflight, computers were still huge machines that took up whole rooms and the results of their calculations had to be sent up to the spacecraft by radio.

You will:
+ Use for loops to repeat actions
+ Create and call functions with parameters
+ Use sprites in your animations

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
You will have to supply the rocket with a certain amount of fuel. Try a very small amount (around 10kg) and a very large amount (around 30000 kg) to see what happens.

![Katherine Johnson](images/katherine_johnson.jpeg){:width="300px"} [Katherine Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson) and her colleagues [Mary Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jackson_(engineer)) and [Dorothy Vaughan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Vaughan), mathmaticians and computer programmers who worked at NASA in the early days of spaceflight, are the subjects of the film 'Hidden Figures'. That film not only gives you a chance to understand the early days of computing, but also showcases the injustices that Johnson and her colleagues had to contend with as black women working in an environment dominated by white men.
