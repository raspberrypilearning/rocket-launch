## Introduction

Make an animation of a rocket launching into orbit. The amount of fuel you give it will decide whether or not it successfully reaches orbit.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Computer simulations**</span> are used to calculate what will happen when we send a rocket into space. Running simulations and making plans on a computer reduces the risk of expensive or dangerous problems in space.
</p>

You will:
+ Use `for` loops to repeat actions
+ **Define** and **call** functions with **input parameters**
+ Use **images** in your animations

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
You will have to supply the rocket with a certain amount of fuel. Try a very small amount (around 10kg) and a very large amount (around 30000 kg) to see what happens.

![Dorothy Vaughan](images/dorothy_vaughan.jpeg){:width="300px"} Dorothy Vaughan made important contributions to early spaceflight. Seeing that the future would be to use electronic computers she taught herself, and her team, how to code.

The film 'Hidden Figures' tells the story of how Dorothy and other black women played a key role in the success of the US space program.
