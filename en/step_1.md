## You will make

Make an animation to propel a satellite into orbit — by hitching a ride on a rocket! Your animation will create cool graphic effects and simulate the best amount of fuel to give the rocket.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Computer simulations**</span> are used to calculate what will happen when we send a rocket into space. Running simulations and making plans on a computer reduces the risk of expensive or dangerous problems in space.

You will:
+ Use **images** in your animations
+ Use `for` loops to repeat actions
+ Join conditions with `and`

You need to supply the rocket with enough fuel to reach the satellite orbit. Try a small amount (around 10,000kg) and a very large amount (around 50,000kg) to see what happens. 

How much fuel is just enough without too much left over?

![Dorothy Vaughan](images/dorothy_vaughan.jpeg){:width="300px"} Dorothy Vaughan made important contributions to early spaceflight. Seeing that the future would use electronic computers, she taught herself, and her team, how to code.

The film *Hidden Figures* tells the story of how Dorothy and other Black women played a key role in the success of the US space program.
