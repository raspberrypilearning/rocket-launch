Which output would you expect if you ran the program below?

```python
for i in range(5):
  print("Looping", i)
```
--- choices ---

- ( ) Looping 1 <br> Looping 2 <br> Looping 3 <br> Looping 4 <br> Looping 5

Not quite, a `for` loop in Python repeats its code once for each item in a sequence it's given starting from `0`.

- ( ) Looping i

  --- feedback ---
Not quite, the **loop variable** from a `for` loop — in this case `i` — holds the current value from the sequence the loop is working through. 
  --- /feedback ---

- (x) Looping 0 <br> Looping 1 <br> Looping 2 <br> Looping 3 <br> Looping 4

  --- feedback ---
Correct. The loop runs once, in order, for each item `i` in the range [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Looping 4 <br> Looping 3 <br> Looping 2 <br> Looping 1 <br> Looping 0

  --- feedback ---
Nto quite, a `for` loop runs through the sequence of items it is given in order. Because `range()` gives an ordered sequence from 0 to the number it is passed, that is the order you would expect to see printed out by this `for` loop.
